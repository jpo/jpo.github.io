Over the last two decades, I've worked on various Software Engineering, Systems Integration, and Data
Science teams, most of which were healthcare focused. I've led a wide range of projects in the
areas of Population Health, Chronic Care Management, Remote Patient Monitoring, Revenue Cycle
Management, and Clinical Research.

I'm a proud graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I studied artificial intelligence
and machine learning.
